This is my submission for Task Seven.
 
I was unable to finish task 7, however I got part way through. I added the necessary changes to the flex and bison files and made some of
the help functions that I knew I would need in my c and header files, however I did not finish filling out these functions. At this point
the program should recognize the tokens for LAMBDA and when an arglist is parsed in but the C functions to fill out the stack do not exist so nothing
will be done with this information.
